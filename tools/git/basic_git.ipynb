For Windows users, the subsystem for linux and WSL2 is highly recommended. It is also assume the user has configured git tokens or SSH to interact with Github or Gitlab.

    "(Under Construction) The gist of the creation of git was a streamlined, open source, and simple version control tool that would provide Linux developers a decentralized version control system to track their code. The core of the design is to be able to track code changes, who is doing the changes, while concurrently have the ability to track the history of changes and undo them if necessary. "

For further reading, you can read how the process works on Github [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo). It is similar for GitLab. It is highly recommended the reader forks the following [repository](https://github.com/heathyates/sample-git-project) and follows along. \n",

    "\n",
    "* First, make sure you create a directory or have a directory which you want to convert a repository \n",
    "* Next, go to the root of the directory and run the command `git init` \n",
    "* You may want to determine the nature of the project and add a `.gitignore`. We will touch more on this later. \n",
    "* Create a path to your remote repository so git has a location to upload the code such as `git remote add origin git@github.com:johnconner/skynetsucks.git`\n",

    "The following is the procedure to add a remote to local machine: \n",
    "\n",
    "* Create a Github or GitLab project to hold desired files \n",
    "* Go to the project homepage and to push an existing folder to this repository. Please copy the command that has `git remote add`\n",
    "* On your local machine, as the section before, in the terminal of the repository that has been initialized, use the command `git remote add origin git@github.com:johnconner/skynetsucks.git` \n",

    "`git pull <REMOTE> <name-of-branch>` \n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that `<REMOTE>` here denotes where the repository was cloned from. Usually, this is something like `origin`. The name of the branch is the name of the branch. Typically it is `main` or whatever word indicates the default branch of your project. Here is a example: \n",

    "## Basic Git Actions and Commands - Branches \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the foundational concepts of git, besides the defining aspects of what makes it version control, is branches. While the term evokes, perhaps, an image of a trunk and branches to form a tree or an evolutionary graph of how several species emerged from an ancestor, in git a branch can be merged back to the main tree trunk again. The real way to understand branches is to understand what it is functionally and why it was designed. \n",
    "\n",
    "Branches are a copy of the files in the main repository at the time the branch is created. This lets the developer change code without affecting the main branch or any other branches. When you are ready to add your changes to the main branch, you can add these changes and merge them into the default branch. \n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, a branch is well suited for the following: \n",
    "\n",
    "* When you want to add code to a project but unsure if it will work properly, this allows for experimentation \n",
    "* You are working on a project with many collaborators and do not wish your work to be mixed with the work of others \n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that a branch is also called a *feature branch*. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Create a branch \n",
    "\n",
    "The command to create a branch is as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    "`git checkout -b <name-of-branch>`\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, for the project we have, we could create a branch such as `git checkout -b my-git-sample-branch`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Switch to a branch \n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to change to another variation of the code, aka branch, you just check out a different branch as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    "`git checkout <name-of-branch>`\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, for our project we could go back to main as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    "`git checkout main`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Push new branch to the repository \n",
    "\n",
    "When you have created a new branch locally, it does not exist yet in version control. You can push these changes from your local branch with the following command: \n",
    "\n",
    "`git push --set-upstream origin <name-of-branch>`"
